# -DIG-1705-_SolarExplorers_FinalProject
A final project I did back in 2017, for the Miami Animation and Gaming International Complex's 3D Programming class. Class code: DIG-1705 This game was made using Unity 5.6.2f1.
When playtesting this game from the Unity editor, it will work as intended when playtesting from the titleScreen scene. This is becuase certain objects the other scenes require are set up in the title screen scene.
